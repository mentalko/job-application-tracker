"""How your CVs and cover letters do: an A/B test across the versions you've sent.

*Applied* is the `applied` stage, or in a workflow without one, the first active stage after
the starting one. Each application you sent (it got to Applied, or was closed after it, or has
a document recorded against it) counts for every document version recorded as sent with it,
and once for each document. Applications with no CV recorded (or no cover letter) make a row
of their own, so you can compare with and without. One closed before it got to Applied (you
decided not to, or the role went) wasn't sent.

For each version, document and that row:
- **sent**: applications;
- **heard back**: any sign of life after applying: a move past Applied, a call, email or
  message logged (logged contact has no direction, so a chaser you sent counts too), a move to
  a closed stage that isn't yours (a rejection is a reply; Withdrawn, Declined and the
  `reopen_from` stages, Ghosted by default, aren't), or an interview round or offer;
- **interviewed**: got past the CV: reached a stage beyond Applied that isn't closed (a screen
  counts), or has an interview round that wasn't cancelled;
- **offers**: an offer recorded, or reached the `offer` stage or a success stage;
- **open** / **ghosted** / **closed**: where they are now;
- **reply days**: median days from applying (when it got to Applied; for one recorded at
  Applied from the start, its backdatable first stage) to the first sign of life.

Undone moves don't count, and nothing dated in the future does either. Rates are out of
`sent`; `interview_low` and `interview_high` are a 95% Wilson interval, so small numbers show
how unsure they are.
